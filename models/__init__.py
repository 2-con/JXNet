# Models
Other models JXNet provides, these models are either a submodel of StandardNet or entirely new models built for JXNet.

### Classifier
  Classification algorithms for JXNet, even though some of these algorithms can be used for regression,
  any label is considered a class and will be treated as such.
  
### Cluster
  Unsupervised learning algorithms for clustering data points.

### Regressor
  Regression algorithms for JXNet with some features such as optimizers and losses. Advanced features such as callbacks or
  validation sets are not supported in these models.
